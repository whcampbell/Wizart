### We're back at it again
Work has started on a third game, and it's not just mine this time. May I introduce...

## The Team, POGLAW
Pascal King - the art / the brains <br>
Owen Wolman - well versed in the trade <br>
George Khankeldian - he's george <br>
Laura Garling - the cool one <br>
Andrew Castelino - wants to do the music(?) <br>
Will Campbell - had the idea (and will provide moral support)

I'll be working with these wonderful folks to make a much bigger project than the ones before! We're still early on in development, so no builds 
to show yet. This will only be a log for now. Keep on coming back to see what we can do!

### Meeting 1 - 9/17/20
For the first part of the meeting, Pascal, Owen and I built up the design doc, discussing possible creative and gameplay ideas. Our plan is a top-down 
magical survival game. The player will have to use various spells and manage their mana in order to fight back the approaching enemy horde 
while navigating an expanding map.

Once everybody got to the office we began with the housekeeping and setup work. First we decided upon VSCode as our IDE. After that there was 
much sharing and inviting, including a github repo, trello board, and the design doc. Owen also got us rolling on GitKraken. Since some of us
hadn't used any of this stuff before (me included, I'd never used trello or kraken), Pascal and Owen stepped in to give some lessons. Pascal
gave us a quick explanation for trello and Owen did the same for Kraken. Pascal then started on the setup for the repo, building up the vital 
structures for engine, rendering, etc. My important contribution was the decision of the trello board's background. 

A successful first day. 

oh yeah I also drew this
